Roadmapping + Journal Club Lesson

roadmapping:
### Roadmapping

- Read over this roadmapping tutorial from Mozilla Open Leaders & check out some of the examples. We won’t be following this exactly, but it is a good overview. [https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/)
- The [syllabus](http://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/syllabus/) can be thought of as the roadmap for the programme, but the point of this exercise is for each of you to map these goals to your own timeline.
- Take the syllabus, and map out the main goals, or “milestones”.  These include things like blogs, learning goals, and workshops. (This can be taken pretty much straight from the syllabus)
- Keep in mind dates and events for the upcoming 9 months. Will you need to change the dates for a specific milestone due to your schedule (work event, school exam, vacation)?
- Think about your personal goals for this fellowship. What are your short term, medium term, and long term goals? Are there milestones that reflect these goals?
- Are there additional milestones you want to add to your roadmap? For example, writing additional blogs, giving additional workshops? These can also be added later.
- Using project management tools: I recommend using project management tools like [Trello](https://trello.com), [GitHub projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/), or simply a  pen + paper planner to write down your main milestone tasks to help you keep track of your progress. If you want to use Trello or GitHub projects and need help, Lilly can help you.

### Journal club
- We’ll be reading “Do you speak open science? Resources and tips to learn the language” by Paola Masuzzo​ and Lennart Martens [https://peerj.com/preprints/2689/](https://peerj.com/preprints/2689/)
- You will all meet virtually to answer the discussion questions and talk about the paper
- **Discussion questions:**
  1. The authors identify four "pillars" of open science: data, code, papers, and review. Do you agree with these? Are there aspects of open science that you think are missing?
  2. When sharing raw data, what other information should also be released?
  3. What are some ways that researchers can openly release their data?
  4. Why is it useful to share the code used in an experiment?
  5. What are some ways to openly share code or software?
  6. What are preprints and how are they different from traditional publications?
  7. What are some reasons why researchers might not publish in open access journals? What are your thoughts on those reasons?
  8. What are some models of open peer review?
  9. What are some benefits and risks of open peer review?

- Follow these instructions to work with an existing Data Package in Python - note: stop at the 'Loading into an SQL database' step. [http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/using-data-packages-in-python/](http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/using-data-packages-in-python/)
- Play around with this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/fellows/blob/master/docs/datapackage-py-notebook.ipynb)

### *OPTIONAL* - Data Packages - using our R [datapackage.r library](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-r)
- Use these instructions to install datapackage.r and create a new datapackage [http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/creating-tabular-data-packages-in-r/](http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/creating-tabular-data-packages-in-r/)
- Follow these instructions to work with an existing Data Package in R - note: stop at the 'Loading into an SQL database' step. [http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/using-data-packages-in-r/](http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/using-data-packages-in-r/)

oaTitle:
Open Access Week Lesson
---
oa:
### Blogging for Open Access Week 2019
- [Open Access Week 2019](http://www.openaccessweek.org) has the theme of 'Open for whom?'
- We will collaboratively write a blog reflecting on the question 'open for whom?'
- The next week, each Fellow will be assigned a day to post their blog text to the [Fellows blog](/blog/oa-week/) by doing a pull request to the GitHub repo (Lilly will help with this). So this way, we will have new content each day of Open Access Week.
- GitHub instructions (Lilly will help you with this):
  - Go to [https://github.com/frictionlessdata/fellows](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/fellows)
  - Clone the repo: click on the green button 'clone or download' and either download it locally, or copy the URL & in the terminal write 'git clone https://github.com/frictionlessdata/fellows.git'. Make sure you are paying attention to where you download this folder.
  - The blog content can be found within the following folder: fellows -> content -> blog -> oa-week -> contents.lr
  - Create a new branch: in the terminal, write 'git checkout -b [your-branch-name]' (replace with your name & remove the brackets)
  - *make sure you don't edit the master branch*
  - You will be editing the 'contents.lr' file
  - Once you finish editing the file, in your terminal, type: 
    - git status
      - make sure everything looks OK
    - git add content/blog/oa-week/contents.lr
    - git commit -m "adds [your name]'s blog"
    - git push origin [your-branch-name]
    - in GitHub, open a pull request (PR) + tag @lwinfree in a comment
    - Lilly will merge your PR
  - **ask Lilly if you need help!**
