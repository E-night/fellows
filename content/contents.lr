## What is the Fellows Program?

With the Frictionless Data Fellows Program, supported by the Sloan Foundation, we are recruiting and training early career researchers to become trainers and evangelists of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in their field(s). These researchers will work with us to lead training workshops at conferences, host events at universities and in labs, and write blogs and other communications content. In addition to mentorship, we are providing successful applicants with stipends of $5,000 to support their work and time during the fellowship. We welcome applications from 8th May 2019 until 30th July 2019.
