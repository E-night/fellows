## The Fellows reflect on Open Access Week
The theme of this year's [Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org) is "Open for Whom", which inspired us to reflect on what Open Access means, why it is important, and especially how the *people* are (positively and negatively) affected by openness in science. Below you will find short thoughts from our four Fellows:

Open science touts the tantalizing prospect of making science accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world. Yet simply making data and code freely available doesn’t make science easier to access for everyone, everywhere. To me this year’s Open Access Week theme is challenging the open science community to think about how we rebuild the inequitable system we are dismantling. How do we make science both physically and accessible, while not putting the burden of transforming the system on marginalized groups? These are, perhaps, the most important questions for the open science community and we must address them before we can hope of making real progressive change to the way knowledge is created and shared.
